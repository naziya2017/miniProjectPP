Programming practices application based mini project on digital system base converter and a calculator named Calconverter
I have made a CalConverter by using html ,css and javascript web application based language.
This calConverter helps us to do real world calculation as addition,subtraction and multilplication,modulus etc.
It provides some trignometric ratios to be calculated also.
The trignometric idendtity must have to use single,with no extra operations once we get the value of it we can perform any task on it.
The second application of this project is base converter.
In computer all the data stores in binaryand addresses are of hexadecimal so we often need our decimal value to be converted into these base value.
This digital base Converter can convert a value from one base to another (min:2,max:2)
